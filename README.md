# Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a secure and efficient system for authentication and role-based authorization. The primary features include:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Registration: Users can create accounts securely.
   - Login: Users can authenticate with their credentials.
   - Logout: Sessions are invalidated securely.
   - JWT-based session management ensures stateless and secure authentication.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).
   - Each role is granted specific permissions to access resources or endpoints.
   - Access to resources is determined dynamically based on the user's role.

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Password hashing using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session handling.
   - Middleware to enforce RBAC and protect routes.

## **Features**

### **Authentication**
- **Register**: Securely creates new user accounts by hashing passwords before storing them.
- **Login**: Verifies user credentials and issues a signed JWT for session management.
- **Logout**: Invalidates tokens to securely log users out.

### **Role-Based Authorization**
- Roles: `Admin`, `User`, `Moderator`.
- Admin: Full access to all resources.
- Moderator: Access to moderate content but limited administrative permissions.
- User: Restricted access to general resources.

### **Middleware**
- **Authentication Middleware**: Validates JWT tokens for secure route access.
- **Authorization Middleware**: Checks user roles and permissions before granting access.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or Python with Flask/Django)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database**: MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL (choose based on your preference)
- **Security**:
  - `bcrypt` for password hashing
  - HTTPS for secure communication (recommended)
  - Helmet.js for additional HTTP headers (if using Node.js)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or later) / Python 3.9+
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL/MySQL (set up database locally or use cloud services)
- Postman or cURL for API testing

### **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prasad052003/VRV-Security-s-Backend-Developer-Intern-Assignment.git
   cd VRV-Security-s-Backend-Developer-Intern-Assignment ```

2. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a .env file with the following keys
      
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGO_DATABASE_URL
   JWT_SECRET = YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD
   PORT = PORT_NUMBER ```
   
   
3. Install Dependencies
   
   ```bash
   npm install ```

4. Start the server
   
     ```bash
     npm start ```
